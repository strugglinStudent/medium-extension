# Free medium Chrome Extension

Free Medium is a lightweight Chrome extension that allows you to quickly redirect the current medium tab to a target URL 'https://freedium-mirror.cfd/' with built-in safety checks.

3. Enable Developer mode.

4. Click Load unpacked and select the extension folder.

## Usage
